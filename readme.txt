Hi, welcome to my image classification project.

I have implemented two models namely, GoogleNet and VGGNet, and compared their performance on the mnist fashion dataset. 

Tensorflow version used - 1.13.1
numpy version used - 1.16

Instructions to run the code. 
 - Make sure you have the correct version of tensorflow and numpy in your environment
 - Pull the repository
 - In your terminal type "python googlenet.py" or "python vggnet.py" to run either of the model.
 - Once the training and testing is finished it will open up the accuracy and loss plots.

As this was my class assignment, you'll find a details pdf report on implementation of the two models and their comparision.
