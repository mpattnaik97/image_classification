Hi, welcome to my image classification project.

I have implemented two models namely, GoogleNet and VGGNet, and compared their performance on the mnist fashion dataset. 

Tensorflow version used - 1.13.1, 
numpy version used - 1.16

Instructions to run the code. 
 - Make sure you have the correct version of tensorflow and numpy in your environment
 - Pull the repository
 - In your terminal type "python googlenet.py" or "python vggnet.py" to run either of the model.
 - Once the training and testing is finished it will open up the accuracy and loss plots.

This repository also contains "Implementation and Analysis Report" which contains a detailed report on implementation of the models and a critical analysis of their performance on 2 hyper parameters namely, learning rate and activation function. Please have a look at the pdf, you might find it useful.
